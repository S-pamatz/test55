My research focuses on teasing out ethical, social, and policy implications of agriculture and food systems, biotechnology, and other technological innovations. I publish widely on food and environmental sovereignty/justice topics, values and agriculture, and the application of genomics technology. I also have a robust literature on climate change mitigation and agricultural systems.","Noll, S. and M. Goldsby. “Climate Change and Conservation Biology as it Relates to Urban

I am a relatively new transplant to WSU and am looking forward to plugging into projects in this context, as well. 

Specifically, I was involved in several environmentally and food related outreach projects. I ran class tours and lectures on ""agriculture ethics and animal welfare"" at the MSU Student Organic
Farm from 2013-2015. I also worked in the ""Raising Pigs on Pasture Project"" at the Michigan State University Student Organic Farm for three years, providing on the ground education in sustainable agriculture practices and pig production to students and community members. Finally, I finished a ""Summer Internship in Community Supported Agriculture/Urban Gardening"" at the Allen Community Center in Lansing, Michigan. During the summer, I worked with community members to develop a more sustainable agricultural system in neighborhoods and parks.","sam.noll@wsu.edu","","","","","","","","","","764","2020-02-17 11:58:28","https://cereo.wsu.edu/invitation-to-participate/","","","","","12562","Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.14; rv:72.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/72.0","134.121.103.83"

Understanding how symbiotic partners co-evolve and adapt to different environments is ecologically and agriculturally important. For example, this will help us explain how cooperation is maintained in the symbiosis between plants and rhizobium bacteria, which is responsible for half of all current biologically fixed terrestrial nitrogen. In this symbiosis, host plants trade photosynthetically derived carbon for nitrogen fixed by endosymbiotic rhizobium bacteria housed in root nodules. We focus on the following questions: 
1) Are there conflicts between mutualists
2) How are cooperative interactions between hosts and symbionts reshaped during biological invasions? 
3) How do symbiotic interactions impact local adaptation to the environment?","Biol403, Evolutionary Biology","Legume-rhizobium educational module for the nitrogen cycle; aimed at elementary school kids, used in the Fairchild Botanical Garden's Fairchild Challenge outreach program.","","","","","","","","","","2086","225","2016-10-07 12:56:00","https://cereo.wsu.edu/invitation-to-participate/","","","","","7581","Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_10_5) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/53.0.2785.116 Safari/537.36","69.166.35.224"

Broadly, I study coupled human and natural systems   I investigate factors that impact environmental and social sustainability across nation-states, and I study how these relationships change over time.  In some of my research I investigate the extent to which sociological theories of global integration help explain variation in countries’ carbon intensity of well-being (CIWB), which is a way to measure a country’s progress toward simultaneous environmental and social sustainability by asking how carbon intensely nation-states produce well-being for citizens.  Carbon-dioxide emissions are a key contributor to climate change, and yet they are also closely related to development, presenting a conundrum for sustainability and sustainable development that comparative international perspectives related to environmental sociology are particularly well-suited to address.  CIWB research addresses core sociological issues of inequality and human well-being and questions of sustainability and energy use pertinent for environmental sociology.  I also conduct research on various forms of individual environmental concern and action, especially as it varies across countries.  My research is quantitative, and I employ both longitudinal and multilevel modeling techniques.  I also engage theoretical perspectives from both environmental and comparative international sociology, including political-economic theoretical perspectives such as the theory of ecologically unequal exchange, world polity and world society theory, treadmill of production and treadmill of destruction theories, ecological modernization theory and the post-materialist values thesis.","Invited Publications

I have a broad interest in the relationship between forager decision making and environmental variability across time and space, and understanding how different adaptive strategies may alter these dynamics over the long term historical record. Guided by models from evolutionary ecology, this work involves examining some of the ideas and assumptions of interpretive frameworks that evaluate the productivity and potential of certain resources or environmental zones.","Salmon and People
